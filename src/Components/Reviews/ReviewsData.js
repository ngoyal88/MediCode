        review:"The app is really wonderful. Being a Product Manager myself, I would say that the User experience (UI/UX) of the app is top notch (easy to use, simple and convenient). Coming to services and delivery, I would say Pharmeasy is doing a tremendous job even during this unprecedented pandemic situation."

        review:"This app is a game changer for me. I am unable to go out always to buy medicinal products. Pharmeasy gives me the last liberty to shop essential healthcare products from home. The app is very user friendly and me being an elderly person do not find any difficulty in using it. They deliver well in time. ThanksðŸ˜Š"
